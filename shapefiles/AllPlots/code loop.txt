# User Input
years = [“2000”, “2002”, “2005”]
sensors: [“etm+”, “oli”]

# Your Code to load the data and print the report for a given year 

for y in years:
	# create an empty raster collection for the year y

(for s in sensors:) might be able to merge it with the next line

	if s in sensors:
		# code to load the data for a given year and sensor
	 
		else:
			continue # if there is no data for this sensor on this year then continue to the next loop

		# Store the data for sensors of a given year
		# generate the yearly report


Or the other way round
for s in sensor:
    if s == "":
        continue # it skips to the next iteration
    else:
        # run your code
